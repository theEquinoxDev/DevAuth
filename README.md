DevAuth - A weekend side-project which is a basic version of OAuth authentication system built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. 
This project allows users to register, login, and manage their authentication tokens securely. This helped me understand the fundamentals of authentication systems and how OAuth works under the hood. 

Will definitely be adding more features to this project in the future!
